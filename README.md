# Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming
This repository contains materials and exercises related to the **Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming** course, offered in the third semester of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Krakow.

## Course Overview
The course introduces students to the basics of object-oriented programming using **C++**, covering:

- Core concepts of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Syntax and features of the **C++** programming language.
- Compilation and linking processes.
- Data types, variables, control structures, and operators in **C++**.
- Functions, function overloading, and object memory management.
- Structures, classes, access specifiers, and static members.
- Class methods, constructors, and destructors.
- Friend functions, nested classes, and namespaces.
- Operator overloading and string handling in **C++**.
- Abstract classes, virtual functions, and polymorphism.
- Practical implementation of object-oriented programming principles.

Laboratory exercises were conducted using **C++**, with a focus on writing structured, efficient, and maintainable code following object-oriented principles.

All programming tasks and exercises were designed to provide a solid foundation in **C++ programming** and **object-oriented design**.
